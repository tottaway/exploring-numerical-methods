# Exploring Numerical Methods

I was inspired by my math class to explore various methods for computing numerical solution to differential equations.

### What I've done so far:
* Worked through examples on http://hplgit.github.io/num-methods-for-PDEs/doc/pub/diffu/sphinx/index.html and learned more about plotting using numpy and matplotlib.
* Compared various method for solving ODE's numerically and computed their orders (Explicit Euler, Heun, Trapezoidal method, RK4)
* Created a simulation of the two dimensional wave equation with options for changing initial conditions, adding periodic forces, and adjusting other various constants

### What's next:
* Implementing a predictor-correct method for solving ordinary differential equations.
* Look into other differential equations

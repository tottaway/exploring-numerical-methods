# Exploring Numerical Methods

I was inspired by my math class to explore various methods for computing numerical solution to differential equations.

### What I've done so far:
* Worked through examples on http://hplgit.github.io/num-methods-for-PDEs/doc/pub/diffu/sphinx/index.html and learned more about plotting using numpy and matplotlib.

### What's next:
* My next step is to read through this article, http://www.math.mcgill.ca/gantumur/docs/reps/RyanSicilianoHH.pdf, and implement the techniques discussed there in python.
* Learning about 3-D plotting/numerical solutions to 2-d wave equation
